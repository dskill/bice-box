// Key Prioritized Tasks TODO:
 ** Fresh SD Card build with no credentials
 -- make sure credentials in git are wiped
 -- hook back up the startup script. Otherwise, keep it pretty vanilla.
 ** WIFI login from device
 ** Just pull new effects on startup maybe?
   - Display the Pi's IP address on-screen for easy connection.
 **WiFi and Effects Update Buttons**
   - Add a button for connecting the pedal to a local WiFi network.

rename install.sh -> launch.sh
make the install script into its own repo that we pull every time at startup
so we can fix things when they get bricked!
